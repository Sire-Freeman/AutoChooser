# AutoChooser
The AutoChooser program is designed to act as a middleman between external software to allow the execution of a random sound file (wav. and .mp3) in a folder in the same directory. This project was motivated as an addition to the great work of FOXVOX (https://foxster.itch.io/foxvox) by Foxter as an addition to the run command. Allowing the BogeyDope's Virtual F-16 Crew Chief (https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/files/3332696/) made by Bogey Dope and alphacheckdesigns4839 to work effectively with FoxVox allowing the variation of voice lines.
