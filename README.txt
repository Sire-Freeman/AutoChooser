
AUTO CHOOSER PROJECT (Alpha Stage)

>Installation<
Place the AutoChooser()().exe and The Pathway.exe into the same folder as your Sound Library Folder (with subfolders of sounds).

>AutoChooser.exe<
The AutoChooser programs are designed to act as a middleman between external software to allow the execution of a random sound file (wav. and .mp3) in a folder in the same directory. 
Instead of only allowing the execution of a SINGLE preselected Mp3 file, the program also forces the directory to be fixed into your sound library folder instead of other locations on your PC. 
The sound will play in the background with no popup and can be closed in Task Manager (for the longer MP3s).

AutoChooser('Sound Folder Name')('Translated directory of the folder location').exe

The program works off the information inside the two brackets. ONLY requiring the user to keep the name 'auto chooser' and two sets of brackets to work.

Example:
Demo AutoChooser version ('Sound Folder Name')('Translated directory of the folder location') aisjdianfaef.exe

>The Pathway.exe<
This acts as an easier user interface to create, adapt and organise through three different options:

1. AutoChooser Generator - Allows the user to create AutoChooser/s based on the folders within the same directory. The user can select folders to generate the AutoChooser/s.

2. Automatic - You can duplicate and adapt the Auto Chooser.exe yourself however instead of translating the directory yourself, you can set the directory for all the Autochoosers in the same folder.

3. Manual - This function converts a directory copy and pasted directory that can function in the second bracket of the AutoChooser.

>LIMITATIONS and ISSUES<
- Pathway requires at LEAST ONE Autochooser file in the same folder
- It can only execute one folder and not subfolders within the folder.
- Subfolder Names MUST NOT have brackets and MUST MATCH the front bracket will result in an error
