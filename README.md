# AutoChooser
The AutoChooser program is designed to act as a middleman between external software to allow the execution of a random sound file (wav. and .mp3) in a folder in the same directory. This project was motivated as a addition to the great work of FOXVOX (https://foxster.itch.io/foxvox) as addition to the run command.
